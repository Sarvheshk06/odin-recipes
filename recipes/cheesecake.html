        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>Cheesecake is a popular, rich, and creamy dessert
         characterized by a base made from crushed cookies,
         graham crackers, or pastry, topped with a thick,
         smooth layer of fresh cheese.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
         <ul>
            <li>1 (8 oz) package Cream Cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream (or 1 container of Cool Whip, thawed)</li>
            <li>1 (9-inch) Prepared Graham Cracker Crust </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Instructions</h3>  
         <ol>
            <li>Prep: Ensure your cream cheese is soft (let it sit out for 30-60 mins) to avoid lumps.</li>
            <li>Mix Cream Cheese: In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla together with a mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add Cream: If using heavy cream, whip it in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form, then gently fold it into the cream cheese mixture. If using Cool Whip, skip whipping and just fold it in.</li>
            <li>Fill Crust: Spread the filling evenly into the prepared graham cracker crust.</li>
            <li>Chill: Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours, or until firm.</li>
            <li>Serve: Top with fruit, chocolate sauce, or whipped cream if desired.</li>
         </ol>
